                    <li>It has been observed that the Concerned <br/>
                        property has been built in a territory <br/>
                        5 miles from a flood zone.<br/>

                        claim during the past 5 years, our analysis <br/>
                        shows that there is a 65% probability of a <br/>
                        claim arising during the next 2 years due <br/>
                        to a "foundation damage due to water seepage".<br/>
                    </li>

                    <li> While accepting the risk, it is recommended <br/>
                        to exclude damage due to perils related to <br/>
                        water damage from flood, sewer back or water<br/>
                        seeping through foundation. Alternatively, <br/>
                        an additional 10% premium should be added<br/>
                        to cover these risks. <br/>
